package: org.epics.ioc.dbDefinition.example<br />
2006.09.07</h1>

<p>This package provides JUnit tests for org.epics.ioc.dbDefinition:<ul>
  <li>XMLToDBDTest.java<br />
    A JUnit test for XMLToDBDFactory.</li>
  <li>DBDTest.java<br />
    A JUnit test for DBDFactory.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>XMLToDBDTest is a Junit test for XMLToDBDFactory. It also is a test for
dbDefinition and pvAccess because XMLToDBD makes extensive use of
dbDefinition and pvAccess. It also provides an example of parsing database
definitions. When run it produces four warning messages. These demonstrate
what happens when an xml file has errors. The output is a dump of all the
dsatabase definitions defined by test.xml.</p>

<p>DBDTest.java is a Junit test for DBDFactory, which implements DBD. It
creates a DBD called master and creates menu definitions. It then creates a
DBD called add which has master as it's master DBD. It creates structure,
recordType, and support definitions in add. It then lists everything in
master and in add. It then merges add into master and again lists everything
in both master and add (master has all definitions and add is empty). It then
dumps everything in master.</p>
