<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This package provides standard support for the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>LinkSupportFactory</dt>
    <dd>Support for the following link types: processLink, inputLink,
      outputLink, and monitorLink.</dd>
  <dt>LinkArraySupportFactory</dt>
    <dd>Support for an array of links. This can be used by most record
    types</dd>
  <dt>ScanSupportFactory</dt>
    <dd>Support for the scan field.</dd>
  <dt>LinearConvertInputFactory</dt>
    <dd>Support for converting a raw value to engineering units. NOT
      IMPLEMENTED.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition a file that does not have an implementation is present.
Something like this will be part of the standard set of record types provided
by javaIOC. It will most likely be moved to a different package perhaps:
<span style="font-family: courier;">org.epics.ioc.recordType.</span></p>
<dl>
  <dt>AnalogInputFactory</dt>
    <dd>A record type that has an input link which provides a raw value,
      converts the raw value to engineering units, and uses linkArray support
      that can have processLink and/or outputLink elements. It will use
      LinearConvertInput to do the conversion.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Link">Link Support Factory</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is a factory that provides an implementation of link support for the
following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>processLink</dt>
    <dd>Support for a link that requests that another record process without
      transfering any data.</dd>
  <dt>inputLink</dt>
    <dd>Support for a link that 1) optionally requests that another record
      process, and 2) transfers data from the other record to the record
      containing the link.</dd>
  <dt>outputLink</dt>
    <dd>Support for a link that 1) transfers data to another record, and 2)
      optionally requests that the other record process.</dd>
  <dt>monitorLink</dt>
    <dd>Support for monitoring another record.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each requires that other support code, e.g. record support knows how to
call them. In addition the code that calls them must call
linkSupport.setField for inputLink, outputLink, and monitorLink.</p>

<p>The types of data that can be transfered are.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both valueType and linkType are scalars and they are copy compatible as
    defined by org.epics.ioc.pvAccess.Convert.isCopyScalarCompatible.</li>
  <li>Both are type Type.pvArray and are copy compatible as defined by
    org.epics.ioc.pvAccess.Convert.isCopyArrayCompatible.</li>
  <li>Both are Type.pvStructure and are copy compatible as defined by
    org.epics.ioc.pvAccess.Convert.isCopyStructureCompatible.</li>
</ul>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt>valueType</dt>
    <dd>The Type for the value field.</dd>
  <dt>linkType</dt>
    <dd>The Type for the link pvname.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Look at the menu and structure definitions in menuStructureSupportDBD for
a description of how the various links are defined.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="Link1">Link Array Support Factory</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is a factory that provides support for an array of links. The
supportName is linkArray. Each array element, which must have element type
link, can be reference any support that implements LinkSupport.</p>

<p>For example any record support could optionally support a field called
process, which is an array of process links. When the record instance
completes processing, it can request the the support for the process field
process. Support for an output record would allow process and output links.
Many other possibilities are possible.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="Scan">Scan Support Factory</h2>
<hr />

<p>This provides support for the scan field of any record. It is called by
RecordProcess.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="Linear">Linear Convert Input Factory</h2>
<hr />

<p>Not implemented but it will be support that takes a raw value and converts
it to engineering units.</p>
