<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This package contains a set of modules that provide basic support
services.</p>

<p>The following factories are provided:</p>

      successfully.</dd>
  <dt>ScanFactory</dt>
    <dd>Complete support for the scan field which is defined in comon.xml</dd>
  <dt>ProcessControlFactory</dt>
    <dd>This is support for the processControl recordType. This record
      controls the process state of the support for another record or for a
      field in another record. It also can set trace and enable on or off for
      the other record.</dd>

    <dd>Support for an array of structures that have support.</dd>
  <dt>DelayFactory</dt>
    <dd>It just causes an asynchronous delay before completing
    successfully.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Generic">Generic Support</h2>
<hr />
<pre>    public class GenericFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p>Generic Support is used for many record/structure definitions including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, string.</li>
  <li>Arrays of the previous types.</li>
  <li>aoIncrementalDouble.</li>
  <li>enumerated - a record with an enum value.</li>
  <li>event - a record that announces events.</li>
</ul>
It can be used for all of these because it just looks for fields that have
associated support and calls the support. It also has a few conventions so
that it works with a variety of support modules. 

<p>GenericSupportFactory implements record or structure support for an
arbitrary set of fields which have associated support. It calls each support
in the order that the fields are defined in the Database Definition File. It
uses the following semantics:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>common</dt>
    <dd>It does not call the support for fields scan, timeStamp, and
      processAfterStart. These are the fields that appear in commom.xml</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">alarm</dt>
    <dd>If field alarm is present and has AlarmSupport then it is handled
      properly.</dd>
  <dt>fields with associated support.</dt>
    <dd>For all fields with support, except the fields in common, the support
      methods are called, i.e. initialize,start,stop,uninitialize, and
      process. For each support process must complete before process for the
      next support module is called.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The above rules allow the generic support to be used for many record types
and embeded versions of these record types. Lets consider an example. double
(either the structure or the recordType) has the following fields which might
have support.:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">input</dt>
    <dd>This is a link field. If support is defined then the record instance
      becomes an input record. The support gets a value and puts it into the
      value field.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">output</dt>
    <dd>This is a link field. If support is defined then the record instance
      becomes an output record. The support gets data from the value field
      and sends it somewhere.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">valueAlarm</dt>
    <dd>This is a link field. If support is defined it is expected to check
      the value field for alarm conditions.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">supportArray</dt>
    <dd>If the supportArray support is defined it is called.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The generic support does not force the support for input to do input, the
support for output to do output, etc. The generic support merely calls
support if it exists. The generic support also does not check the types of
any fields but looks for support and calls it if it exists. Thus the generic
support can be used for many different types of data and many different types
of support.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Noop">Noop Support</h2>
<hr />
<pre>    public class NoopFactory {
        public static Support create(DBField dbField);
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p>This can be used for record types that just hold data. It can also be used
to provide support for any field. The support acts as though it is
synchronous. All Support methods are implemented by just extending
AbstractSupport without overriding any methods.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="ScanSuppor">ScanSupport</h2>
<hr />

<p>Support is provided for the scan field. This support is called by
recordProcess. The support handles all the fields in structure scan:</p>

<p>At initialization and whenever the scan, priority, rate, or eventName
fields are modified, the support interacts with the appropriate scanners to
add or remove the record from the scanner. If processSelf is set true, the
support implements ScanSupport.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: RecordProcess provides the same methods as ScanSupport. Support
code must call the RecordProcess methods rather than calling the ScanSupport
methods.</p>

<p>The following definitions are provided:</p>
<pre>    public interface ScanSupport extends Support {
        boolean canProcessSelf();
        boolean processSelfRequest(RecordProcessRequester recordProcessRequester);
        void processSelfSetActive(RecordProcessRequester recordProcessRequester);
        void processSelfProcess(RecordProcessRequester recordProcessRequester,
            boolean leaveActive);
        void processSelfSetInactive(RecordProcessRequester recordProcessRequester);
    }
    public class ScanFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p><span style="font-family: courier;">ScanSupport</span>, which MUST only be
called by recordProcess, extends <span
style="font-family: courier;">Support</span> with the methods:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">canScanSelf</dt>
    <dd>Can the record scan itself? This is true if scan.scanSelf is true. In
      this case scanSupport itself owns and processes the record.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">processSelfRequest</dt>
    <dd>Request to process the record. This returns true if scanSupport is
      the record processor and the record is not active.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">processSelfSetActive</dt>
    <dd>If processSelfRequest returns true this can be called to set the
      record active. This is called when user code wants to modify data in
      the record before calling processSelfProcess.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">processSelfProcess</dt>
    <dd>If processSelfRequest returns true this can be called to process the
      record.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">processSelfSetInactive</dt>
    <dd>If the call to processSelfProcess said to leave the record active,
      this is called to set the record inactive. This is done if the caller
      wants to read data from the record after processing.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="ProcessCon">ProcessControl Support</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is support for the processControl recordType. It provides the
following features:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>trace</dt>
    <dd>Trace can be turned on or off for a record instance.</dd>
  <dt>enable</dt>
    <dd>Processing of a record instance can be enabled or disabled.</dd>
  <dt>Support State</dt>
    <dd>The process state of the support for a record or a field within a
      record can be set. This involves calling one of the following methods:
      initialize, start, stop, uninitialize.</dd>
  <dt>Support</dt>
    <dd>The support for a field can be changed. In order to make this change,
      the record instance must be in the readyForInitialize state. It is not
      possible to change the support for the record itself. </dd>
  <dt>Structure</dt>
    <dd>If a field is a structure, then the structure itself can be changed.
      In order to make this change, the record instance must be in the
      readyForInitialize state. It is not possible to change the structure
      for the record itself.</dd>
  <dt>Reporting</dt>
    <dd>All problems are reported via field message. Other fields show the
      current values for trace, enable, record support state, field support
      state, name of the field support, and the name of the structure for a
      field.</dd>
</dl>

<p>ProcessControl only performs actions when it is processed.</p>

<p>processControl.html describes the fields contained in a processControl
record. It has the definitions:</p>
<pre>&lt;structure name = "supportStateCommand" createName = "enumerated" &gt;
  &lt;field name = "index" type = "int" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "choice" type = "string" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "choices" type = "array" elementType = "string"
    default = "idle initialize start stop uninitialize" /&gt;
&lt;/structure&gt;

&lt;recordType name = "processControl" supportName = "processControl" &gt;
  &lt;field name = "message" type = "string" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "recordName" type = "string" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "trace" type = "structure" structureName = "booleanState" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "enable" type = "structure" structureName = "booleanState" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "supportStateRecord" type = "structure" structureName = "supportState" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "supportStateCommandRecord" type = "structure" structureName = "supportStateCommand" /&gt;
  &lt;!-- remaining fields refer to a field of the record --&gt;
  &lt;field name = "fieldName" type = "structure" structureName = "stringState"  /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "supportState" type = "structure" structureName = "supportState" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "supportStateCommand" type = "structure" structureName = "supportStateCommand" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "supportName" type = "structure" structureName = "stringState" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "structureName" type = "structure" structureName = "stringState" /&gt;
&lt;/recordType&gt;


&lt;support name = "processControl"
   factoryName = "org.epics.ioc.support.ProcessControlFactory" /&gt;</pre>

<p>Structure supportStateCommand is an enumerated structure with the
following choices</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">idle</dt>
    <dd>A do nothing commamnd. After the processControl support executes one
      of the other commands, it sets the choice to idle.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">initialize</dt>
    <dd>Call the initialize method of the support.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">start</dt>
    <dd>Call the start method of the support.</dd>

    <dd>Call the stop method of the support.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">uninitialize</dt>
    <dd>Call the uninitialize method of the support.</dd>
</dl>

<p>recordType processControl has fields trace, enable, fieldName,
supportName, and structureName. Each is a structure field with the following
fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">value</dt>
    <dd>This holds the current value.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">desiredValue</dt>
    <dd>This is set by the user to give the desired value.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">setValue</dt>
    <dd>This is a boolean field. The user sets this to true to request the
      the value be set to the dersired value. processControl sets this back
      to false after processing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>recordType processControl has the following fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">message</dt>
    <dd>If processControl encounters any problems it puts a value in this
      field. </dd>

    <dd>A structure for changing the structure for the field.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Linear">Linear Conversion</h2>
<hr />

<p>Support is available for input and output linear conversions. The xml
definitions for linear conversions are:</p>

<h3 id="linearConv">linearConversion</h3>

<p>The structure linearConversion defines the fields used for linear
conversions. The fields slope and intercept are the values used to convert a
rawValue to engineering units. The rawValue is an integer value usually read
from an ADC (Analog to Digital Convertor). The slope and intercept can be
specified directly of calculated from the low and high engineering and device
values. If the later method is chosen the engUnitsLow and engUnitsHigh must
be provided. deviceLow and deviceHigh are either provided automatically by
support of must be provided. The following are the fields in structure
lineraConversion:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">engUnitsLow</dt>
    <dd>A double equal to the engineering units value corresponding to the
      value for deviceHigh.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">engUnitsHigh</dt>
    <dd>A double equal to the engineering units value corresponding to the
      value for deviceLow.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">deviceHigh</dt>
    <dd>An int equal to the maximum value for the rawValue.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">deviceLow</dt>
    <dd>An int equal to the minimum value for the rawValue.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">slope</dt>
    <dd>The slope for the linear conversion.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">intercept</dt>
    <dd>The intercept for the linear conversion.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="LinearConv">LinearConvertInputFactory</h3>
<pre>    public class LinearConvertInputFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p>This is the factory that implements linear input conversion, i.e. it
converts a rawValue to engineering units. A field for linear conversion for
input is a structure containing the following fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">rawValue</dt>
    <dd>The raw value which is obtained via the support attached to the input
      field or by a put to this field.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">linearConvert</dt>
    <dd>The structure providing the conversion parameters.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">input</dt>
    <dd>The link for reading the rawValue. If a field named is defined and
      has support the support is called.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="LinearConv1">LinearConvertOutputFactory</h3>
<pre>    public class LinearConvertOutputFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p>This is the factory that implements linear output conversion, i.e. it
converts a value in engineering units to a rawValue. A field for linear
conversion for output is a structure containing the following fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">rawValue</dt>
    <dd>The raw value which is obtained via the support attached to the input
      field or by a put to this field.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">linearConvert</dt>
    <dd>The structure providing the conversion parameters.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">output</dt>
    <dd>The link for reading the rawValue. If a field named is defined and
      has support the support is called.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Digital">Digital Support</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is support for a record or structure that supports digital I/O. </p>

<h3 id="Java">Java Definitions</h3>
<pre>    public class DigitalFactory {
        public static Support create(DBField dbField);
    }</pre>

<p>The dbField must be an array of digitalState structures. The enumerated
value field must be in the parent of the parent of dbField. The register
value must be in the parent of dbField. During initialization it sets the
array of choices for the value field. It uses the name fields in the states
array to create the choices.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Incrementa">Incremental Support</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is support for incremental outputs.For example it supports the
aoIncrementalOutut record.</p>

<p>This uses the Java definitions:</p>
<pre>    public interface IncrementalSupport extends Support{
        void setDesiredField(DBField dbField);
    }

    public class IncrementalFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>

<p>This supports the following fields:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">value</dt>
    <dd>The value field.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">desiredValue</dt>
    <dd>This must be a double field. It can either be a field named in the
      record or structure being supported or it can be a field passed as an
      argument to the double support setDesiredField method. When this field
      changes the support changes the value field until it has the desired
      value. If control limits are specified then the desired value is forced
      to be within the control limits. If incrementalOutput is true then each
      time the record is processed the value field is changed by rateOfChange
      until the desired value is reached.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">input</dt>
    <dd>If this field exists and has support it is called to get the
      desiredValue.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">controlLimit</dt>
    <dd>This field is optional. If present it must be a structure that has
      two double fields named. If the low value is strictly less that the
      high value then limits are enforced, i.e. the desired value is forced
      to be within the control limits.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">incrementalOutput</dt>
    <dd>This field is optional. If the record/structure has a field named
      then it must be have type boolean. If not present the default is true.
      If this has the value true the output is adjusted by rateOfChange
      otherwise the value field is changed in one step to the desired
    value.</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">rateOfChange</dt>
    <dd>If incrementalOutput is true this is the amount the value will change
      each time the record is processed.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Event">Event Support</h2>
<hr />
<pre>    public class EventFactory {
        public static Support create(DBField dbField);
    }</pre>

<p>EventFactory implements record or structure support for announcing a scan
event. The event name is given in the field:</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">value</dt>
    <dd>This must be a string field named located in the parent of this
      field, which is normally the value field itself.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Whenever the record is processed eventScanner.announce is called, i.e. the
support announces an event. All event scanned records with the event name
associated with the value field are processed. Each time process is called,
the event support checks to see if the event name has changed.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="SupportArr">SupportArray Support</h2>
<hr />
<pre>    public class SupportArrayFactory {
        public static Support create(DBField dbField);
    }</pre>

<p>This is a factory that provides support for an array of structures. The
supportName is SupportArray. If any of the array elements has support, the
support is called. If the structure is a</p>

<p>supportArrayElement structure then it also supports the wait field, which
if true, waits for all the previous supports to complete before calling the
support for the link field.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="DelaySuppo">DelaySupport Support</h2>
<hr />

<p>This is link support that simulates asynchronous support. It uses a
configStructure that has the definition:</p>
<pre>&lt;structure name = "delay" supportName = "delay"&gt;
  &lt;!-- min, max, inc are delay in milliseconds --&gt;
  &lt;field name = "min" type = "long" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "max" type = "long" /&gt;
  &lt;field name = "inc" type = "long" /&gt;
&lt;/structure&gt;

&lt;support name = "delay"
  factoryName = "org.epics.ioc.support.DelayFactory" /&gt;</pre>

<p>where</p>
<dl>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">min</dt>
    <dd>The minimum delay</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">max</dt>
    <dd>The maximum delay</dd>
  <dt style="font-family: courier;">inc</dt>
    <dd>The delay increment between process requests</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each time process is called it delays a number of milliseconds determined
by min,max, and inc. It starts with a delay on min. Each time it proceses it
increases the delay by inc until it reaches max. It then goes back to a delay
of min.</p>

<p>The factory definition is:</p>
<pre>    public class DelaySupportFactory {
        public static Support create(DBStructure dbStructure);
    }</pre>
</body>
</html>
