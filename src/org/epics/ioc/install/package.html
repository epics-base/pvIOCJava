<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This package provides code to install structures and records into a
javaIOC. A javaIOC is started via JavaIOC.main. Once started structures and
records can be installed either by JavaIOC or by any thread running as part
of the javaIOC.</p>

<p>A javaIOC has two databases: a PVDatabase and an IOCDatabase. The
PVDatabase, which is described in project pvData, holds the memory resident
data. The IOCDatabase provides access to the PVDatabase and to support code.
Both databases are named master.</p>

<p>New structure instances or record instances can be installed into a
running javaIOC. It is not legal to install both new structures and records
at the same time. Installation is done as follows: New instances are read
into a new PVDatabase named beingInstalled. If any error is detected while
reading the file, nothing more is done, i.e. installation fails. If the
beingInstalled database has only structure definitions the new definitions
are merged into master and installation is complete. If the beingInstalled
database has only record instances then the record instances are initialized
and started. If any record can not be started nothing more is done, i.e. the
installation fails. If all records start then an AfterStart procedure
described below is performed. As part of this procedure the new record
instances are merged into master. When the AfterStart procedure is done
installation is done. The InstallFactory ensures that only one installation
at a time is allowed.</p>

<p>This overview describes the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>InstallFactory</dt>
    <dd>The factory for installing structures or records.</dd>
  <dt>IOCDatabase</dt>
    <dd>The database that provides access to support code.</dd>
  <dt>SupportCreation</dt>
    <dd>Support to create, initialize, and start records.</dd>
  <dt>AfterStart</dt>
    <dd>Support that allows support and servers to perform various functions
      after new records have started but before installation is complete.
      After Start allows unrelated support to execute in parallel.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Install">Install Factory</h2>
<hr />

<p>InstallFactory is used to install structure or records into a javaIOC.
Only one set of definitions at a time can be installed.</p>

<h3 id="Definition">Definitions</h3>
<pre>public class InstallFactory {
    public static boolean installStructures(String file,Requester requester);
    public static boolean installRecords(String file,Requester requester);
}</pre>

<h3 id="installStr">installStructures</h3>

<p>Install structure definitions from file. The file must contain xml
structure definitions as described in project pvData. If the file is read
successfully and contains only structure definitions the new definitions are
merged into master. The return value is (false,true) if the new structures
(were not, were) installed.</p>

<h3 id="installRec">installRecords</h3>

<p>Install record definitions from file. The file must contain xml record
definitions as described in project pvData. If the file fails or the file has
any structure definitions install fails and nothing more is done.</p>

<p>Next a beingInstalled PVDatabase and a SupportCreation is created and the
following steps performed.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>createSupport</dt>
    <dd>supportCreation.createSupport is called. If it fails installation
      fails.</dd>
  <dt>initialize</dt>
    <dd>supportCreation.initializeSupport is called. If it fails installation
      fails.</dd>
  <dt>start</dt>
    <dd>An AfterStart is created and then supportCreation.start(afterStart)
      is called. If it fails nothing more is done.</dd>
  <dt>before merge</dt>
    <dd>afterStart.callRequesters(false) is called.</dd>
  <dt>merge</dt>
    <dd>The beingInstalled databases (PVDatabase and IOCDatabase) are each
      merged into the corresponding master database.</dd>
  <dt>after merge</dt>
    <dd>afterStart.callRequesters(true) is called.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The return value is (false,true) if the new records (were not, were)
installed.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="IOCDatabas">IOCDatabase</h2>
<hr />

<p>An IOCDatabase provides access to the RecordProcess that is attached to
every record instance and to the support that is optionally attached to
fields of a record.</p>

<h3 id="Definition1">Definitions</h3>
<pre>public class IOCDatabaseFactory {
    public static synchronized IOCDatabase create(PVDatabase pvDatabase);
    public static synchronized IOCDatabase get(PVDatabase pvDatabase);
}

public interface IOCDatabase {
    PVDatabase getPVDatabase();
    void mergeIntoMaster();
    LocateSupport getLocateSupport(PVRecord pvRecord);
}

public interface LocateSupport {
    RecordProcess getRecordProcess();
    void setRecordProcess(RecordProcess recordProcess);
    Support getSupport(PVField pvField);
    void setSupport(PVField pvField,Support support);
}</pre>

<h3 id="IOCDatabas1">IOCDatabaseFactory</h3>

<p>Given a PVDatabase this is used to create and located an IOCDatabase.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>create</dt>
    <dd>Create a new IOCDatabase for the pbDatabase.</dd>
  <dt>get</dt>
    <dd>Get the IOCDatabase for the PVDatabase. It returns null if it does
      not exist.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="IOCDatabas2">IOCDatabase</h3>

<p>This is the interface for an IOCDatabase.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getPVDatabase</dt>
    <dd>Get the PVDatabase for this IOCDatabase.</dd>
  <dt>mergeIntoMaster</dt>
    <dd>Merge the IOCDatabase into the master IOCDatabase. This is called by
      InstallFactory.</dd>
  <dt>getLocateSupport</dt>
    <dd>Get the LocateSupport for the record. </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="LocateSupp">LocateSupport</h3>

<p>A LocateSupport exists for each record.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>getRecordProcess</dt>
    <dd>Get the RecordProcess for the record.</dd>
  <dt>setRecordProcess</dt>
    <dd>Set the RecordProcess for the record. This is called by
      SupportCreation.</dd>
  <dt>getSupport</dt>
    <dd>Get the support for the field. If no support then null is
    returned.</dd>
  <dt>setSupport</dt>
    <dd>Set the support for the field. This is called by SupportCreation.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="Support">Support Creation</h2>
<hr />

<p>A SupportCreation is used to create, initialize, and start record
instances. After it is done it is no longer accessable.</p>

<h3 id="Definition2">Definitions</h3>
<pre>public class SupportCreationFactory {
    static public SupportCreation create(
         IOCDatabase supportDatabase,Requester requester);
}

public interface SupportCreation {
    boolean createSupport();
    boolean initializeSupport();
    boolean  startSupport(AfterStart afterStart);
}</pre>

<h3 id="Factory">Factory</h3>

<p>This has the single method which creates a SupportCreation.</p>

<h3 id="SupportCre">SupportCreation</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>createSupport</dt>
    <dd>Create the support. It first created a RecordProcess and then support
      for fields with support.</dd>
  <dt>initializeSupport</dt>
    <dd>Initialize the support. For each record it calls
      recordProcess.initialize. It returns true if all records are
      initialized.</dd>
  <dt>startSupport</dt>
    <dd>Start the support. For each record it calls recordProcess.start. It
      returns true if all records are started.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center;" id="After">After Start</h2>
<hr />

<p>After Start is a facility that allows support code and servers like
Channel Access to perform various functions after new records are started but
before installation completes. It is designed so that unrelated functions can
execute in parallel and so that related functions can execute in the order
they require</p>

<p>Code can request to be called back before or after the beingInstalled is
merged into the master. Each request also specifies a priority. A callback
should not block. When it is done it must notify AfterStart that is is done.
All callbacks at a particular priority must complete before the callbacks at
the next lower priority are called.</p>

<p>The start method of Support is defined as: <pre>    void start(AfterStart afterStart);</pre>
The support code can call afterStart.requestCallback. If so it must implement
interface AfterStartRequester. When AfterStartRequester.callback is called
the support code can do what it wants but should not block. Instead it should
arrage for some other thread to do the work. When done the support code must
call afterStart.done.</p>

<p>Servers, i. e. code that is not attached to a record can call
AfterStartFactory.newAfterStartRegister. An example of a server is Channel
Access. The NewAfterStartRequester is called each time a new AfterStart is
created, i.e. every time a new set of records are being installed. The server
can then call afterStart.requestCallback just like support code.</p>

<h3 id="Definition3">Definitions</h3>
<pre>public interface AfterStartNode {}

public interface AfterStartRequester {
    void callback(AfterStartNode node);
}

public class AfterStartFactory {
    public static  AfterStart create();
    public static AfterStartNode allocNode(AfterStartRequester requester);
    public static void newAfterStartRegister(NewAfterStartRequester requester);
    public static void newAfterStartUnregister(NewAfterStartRequester requester);
}

public interface AfterStart {
    void callRequesters(boolean afterMerge);
    void requestCallback(AfterStartNode node,boolean afterMerge,ThreadPriority priority);
    void done(AfterStartNode node);
    void doneAndRequest(AfterStartNode node,boolean afterMerge,ThreadPriority priority);
}


public interface NewAfterStartRequester {
    void callback(AfterStart afterStart);
}</pre>

<h3 id="AfterStart">AfterStartNode</h3>

<p>Any code that calls afterStart.requestCallback must create an
afterStartNode by calling AfterStartFactory.allocNode. It passes this to
afterStart.requestCallback. A node can only be on one request list at a
time.</p>

<h3 id="AfterStart1">AfterStartRequester</h3>

<p>This is the interface which must be implemented by code that calls
afterStart.requestCallback. It has a single method which is the callback.</p>

<h3 id="NewAfterSt">NewAfterStartRequester</h3>

<p>This is the interface which must be implemented by code that calls
AfterStartFactory.NewAfterStartRegister.</p>

<h3 id="AfterStart2">AfterStartFactory</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>create</dt>
    <dd>Create a new AfterStart. This is called by InstallFactory.</dd>
  <dt>allocNode</dt>
    <dd>This is called by any code that calls afterStart.requestCallback. It
      can be reused as desired but a node can only be on a single request
      queue at any given time. </dd>
  <dt>NewAfterStartRegister</dt>
    <dd>This is called by code that wants to be notified when a new
      AfterStart is created, i.e. when new records are being installed.</dd>
  <dt>NewAfterStartUnregister</dt>
    <dd>Remove a NewAfterStartRequester.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="AfterStart3">AfterStart</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>callRequesters</dt>
    <dd>Call requesters. This is called by InstallFactory.</dd>
  <dt>requestCallback</dt>
    <dd>A request to be called back. The ThreadPriority does not choose a
      thread but just a priority.</dd>
  <dt>done</dt>
    <dd>The callback is done.</dd>
  <dt>doneAndRequest</dt>
    <dd>The callback is done but want to be called back again. The new
      request queue must be for a later time then the current queue.</dd>
