<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This package provides a GUI shell implemented via the SWT toolkit that
comes with eclipse. The default JavaIOC package overview document gives brief
instructions for starting the swtshell. If you want to communicate with a V3
EPICS IOC then the option "-server server/beforeStartIOC.txt" must be given
when the javaIOC is started.</p>

<p>The following window appears when swtshell is started:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./swtshell.gif" alt="swtshell" /></p>
</center>

<p>The window has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>get, put, process, monitor, and array:<br />
    Each of these brings up another window which provides the ability to
    access data via channel access. The next section describes these
  windows:</li>
  <li>iocConsole<br />
    This provide a window which shows all messages sent to any record of the
    local javaIOC. This is shown in a later section.</li>
  <li>loadDatabase and introspectDatabase<br />
    Each of these buttons starts another window for interacting with the
    local javaIOC. They are described bnelow.</li>
  <li>portDriver<br />
    Starts a window for interacting with a portDriver port and device.</li>
  <li>v3iocshell<br />
    The v3iocshell buttom starts a V3 epics ioc that is part of the same
    process as the javaIOC. In the future this will be used to communicate
    with asynDriver port drivers. For now this button is not documented. </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span>: After text is typed into any
text input window, the enter key must be pressed.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Channel">Channel Access</h2>
<hr />

<p>The get, put, process, monitor, and array buttons each start a new window.
Each window provides the ability to connect to a PV (Process Variable). </p>

<p>This window gets data from a local or remote IOC. The data is accessed via
Channel Access, which can be either V3 or V4 channelAccess</p>

<p>ForEPICS V3 Channel Access only the following data can be accessed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>primitive data </li>
  <li>array of primitive data</li>
  <li>Channel Access V3 properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>See package org.epics.ioc.caV3 for details about caV3.</p>

<h3 id="Connecting">Connecting to a Channel</h3>

<p>The get, put, process, monotor, and array windows all have a connect
button. When this button is pressed the following window appears:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./connectChannel.gif" alt="connectChannel" /></p>
</center>

<p>If selectLocalRecord is clicked then a list of all the records in the
local javaIOC is presented. When a record is selected a request is made to
create a channel connected to the record and control returned to the window
that has the connect button.</p>

<p>A pvname can be entered. When return is given a request is made to create
a channel to the selected record and control returned to the window that has
the connect button.</p>

<h3 id="Creating">Creating a Request</h3>

<p>The get, put, and monotor windows all have a createRequest button, which
is activated after connecting to a channel. createRequest allows you to
select an arbitarary set of fields from the PVRecord to which the channel is
connected. When the createRequest button is pressed the following window
appears:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./createRequest.gif" alt="createRequest" /></p>
</center>

<p>If shareData is selected then when a request is made it is a request for
shared data. This means that the server will share the scalar and array data
with the record itself instead of keeping a copy. If showRequest is selected
then when createRequest is done the created request structure is shown.</p>

<p>When the createRequest button is clicked the following window appears:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./getSubSet.gif" alt="getSubSet" /></p>
</center>

<p>This window allows the user to select an arbitrary set of fields from the
PVRecord to which the channel is attached. When the arrow for a structure
field is clicked the fields for that structure appear. A field is selected by
clicking the bod next to the field name. If a structure field is selected the
entire structure is selected.</p>

<h3 id="get">get</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the get button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./get.gif" alt="get" /></p>
</center>

<p>The first row has the following widgets:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>conect</dt>
    <dd>This was described above.</dd>
  <dt>process</dt>
    <dd>This says if a get is a get or a getProcess.</dd>
  <dt>createRequest</dt>
    <dd>This was described above.</dd>
  <dt>disconnect</dt>
    <dd>Disconnect from the channel.</dd>
  <dt>get</dt>
    <dd>Issue a get request. The result is shown in the text window.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="put">put</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the put button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./put.gif" alt="put" /></p>
</center>

<p>Except for put the top row is just like get.</p>

<p>When the put button is clicked then what happens depends of how many
fields where selected from the PVRecord. If only a single scalar or array
field was selected, then a text entry box apppears. When a value is entered
and the return key is pressed then this value is sent via channel access.</p>

<p>If more than a single scalar or array field waas selected then when put is
clicked a window appears that allows the user to provide values to each
scalar or array field of the selected fields. This window is:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./getValue.gif" alt="getValue" /></p>
</center>

<p>This display allows the user to give values to any of the scalar or array
fields.</p>

<p>If a primitive or array of primitives is selected then when edit is
clicked the following happens: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The text entry window shows the current value.</li>
  <li>After text is entered and the enter key presssed the data is put in the
    PVStructure created as a result of createRequest.</li>
</ul>

<p>When done is clicked the modified fields are sent to the channel access
server and written to the PVRecord.</p>

<h3 id="process">process</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the process button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./process.gif" alt="process" /></p>
</center>

<p>The connect an disconnect buttons are for connecting and disconnecting
to/from a channel. The process button sends a process request to the channel
access server.</p>

<h3 id="monitor">monitor</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the monitor button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./monitor.gif" alt="monitor" /></p>
</center>

<p>The controls in the first row are like for get and put.</p>

<p>The second row and third allows you to set the:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>queueSize</dt>
    <dd>The queue size. A value of 3 or more means that a queue will be kept
      on the server. A value of 2 is automatically set to 3. A value &lt;2
      means that no queue will be created on the server. Also if shareData
      was specified on createRequest than no queue is created. </dd>
  <dt>deadband</dt>
    <dd>A deadband to use if onAbsolute or onPercentage are seleccted.</dd>
  <dt>onPut, ...,onPercentage</dt>
    <dd>A set of radio buttons that determines the type of change which will
      cause a monitor to occur.</dd>
  <dt>When startMonitor is clicked monitoring is started. It changes to
  stopMonitor button while monitoring is active.</dt>
</dl>

<h3 id="loadDataba">loadDatabase</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the loadDatabase button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./loadDatabase.gif" alt="loadDatabase" /></p>
</center>

<p>This is used to load additional IOCDB definitions to a running IOC. It has
the following controls:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>find</dt>
    <dd>This brings up a file selection box that allows the selection of a
      DBD or DB file.</dd>
  <dt>show</dt>
    <dd>Lists the selected file.</dd>
  <dt>loadDB</dt>
    <dd>Adds definitions from the selected file to the JavaIOC file.
      Structure, create, and support definitions are added only if the file
      loads without error. It is an error if the definition already
    exists.</dd>
    <dd>Record instances are loaded, initialized, and started. If all of the
      new record instances are stated, then the records are added to ther
      master database. If any record fails to start, all the records are
      uinitialized and are not added to the master database.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="introspect">introspectDatabase</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the introspectDatabase button is
pushed:</p>

<p>The top menubar allows the use to see all the structure definitions in the
master database.</p>

<h4 id="Local1">Local Record Instance</h4>

<p>The next three row allows the user to select and interact with a local
record. The select button is used to select a local record. The text window
after select shows the currently selected record and can also be used to
enter a record name. The remaining buttons apply to the selected button. They
are:</p>

      start, stop, or uninitialize.</dd>
  <dt>releaseProcessor</dt>
    <dd>Allows the use to force the release of the current record processor.
      This is a dangorous operation!!</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="Show">Show Information</h4>

<p>The third row has two buttons that show information. They are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>showBadRecords</dt>
