<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>This package provides a GUI shell implemented via the SWT toolkit that
comes with eclipse. The default JavaIOC package overview document gives brief
instructions for starting the swtshell. If you want to communicate with
another javaIOC then the option "-server server/beforeStartCAV4.txt" must be
given when the javaIOC is started. If you want to communicate with a V3 EPICS
IOC then the option "-server server/beforeStartCAV3.txt" must be given. </p>

<p>The following window appears when swtshell is started:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./swtshell.gif" alt="swtshell" /></p>
</center>

<p>The window has the following buttons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>channelList:<br />
    This obtains a list of the channels in a javaIOC. </li>
  <li>process,get,put,putGet,channelRPC, monitor, array, and
    structureArray:<br />
    Each of these brings up another window which provides the ability to
    access data via channel access. The next section describes these
  windows:</li>
  <li>iocConsole<br />
    This provide a window which shows all messages sent to any record of the
    local javaIOC. This is shown in a later section.</li>
  <li>loadDatabase and introspectDatabase<br />
    Each of these buttons starts another window for interacting with the
    local javaIOC. They are described below.</li>
  <li>portDriver<br />
    Starts a window for interacting with a portDriver port and device.</li>
  <li>v3iocshell<br />
    The v3iocshell buttom starts a V3 epics ioc that is part of the same
    process as the javaIOC. In the future this will be used to communicate
    with asynDriver port drivers. For now this button is not documented. </li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span>: After text is typed into any
text input window, the enter key must be pressed.</p>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Channel">Channel Access</h2>
<hr />

<p>The channelList, get, put, process,putGet,channelRPC, monitor,array, and
structureArray buttons each start a new window. Each window provides the
ability to connect to a PV (Process Variable). </p>

<p>The window gets data from a local or remote IOC. The data is accessed via
Channel Access, which can be either V3 or V4 channelAccess</p>

<p>For EPICS V3 Channel Access only the following data can be accessed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>primitive data </li>
  <li>array of primitive data</li>
  <li>Channel Access V3 properties.</li>
</ul>

<p>See package org.epics.ioc.caV3 for details about caV3.</p>

<h3 id="Getting">Getting a list of the channels in a javaIOC.</h3>

<p>This obtains a list of a subset, selected by a regular expression, of the
records in a javaIOC. A name can be selected and dropped into a connect
window descibed in the next sub-section.</p>

<p>When channelList is selected from the main swtshell window the following
window appears.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./channelList.gif" alt="channelList" /></p>
</center>

<p>The provider is normally CAV4 but could also be selected as local, i.e.
the javaIOC that is in the same process as swtshell. The icname must be
specified. A regular expression selects the set of records to list. The above
example selects all records with names ending in "RPC". The default regular
expression ".*" selects all records. When the enter key is pressed in the
regularExpression, the list of channels is read via channel access.</p>

<p>The implementation issues a channel access putGet request to get the
channel list It requres that the javaIOC have an RPC record ( RPC records are
descibed below) that provides the record list. The record must be named
"${IOCNAME}recordListRPC" where IOCNAME is the name of the javaIOC.</p>

<h3 id="Connecting">Connecting to a Channel</h3>

<p>The process,get, put, putGet, channelRPC, monitor, and array windows all
have a connect button. When this button is pressed the following window
appears:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./connectChannel.gif" alt="connectChannel" /></p>
</center>

<p>If selectLocalRecord is clicked then a list of all the records in the
local javaIOC is presented. When a record is selected a request is made to
create a channel connected to the record and control returned to the window
that has the connect button.</p>

<p>For a remote record a pvname can be entered. Note that the record name can
be obtained from the channelList described in the previous sub-section. When
return is clicked a request is made to create a channel to the selected
record and control returned to the window that has the connect button.</p>

<h3 id="Creating">Creating a Request</h3>

<p>The get, put, putGet and monotor windows all have a createRequest button,
which can activated after connecting to a channel. createRequest allows you
to select an arbitarary set of fields from the PVRecord to which the channel
is connected. All also show a text window with the curent request string
displayed. This text window can be modified or the createRequest button can
be clicked to use introspection to select a set of fields.</p>

<p>When the createRequest button is pressed the following window appears:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./createRequest.gif" alt="createRequest" /></p>
</center>

<p>Again the text window can be edited. If options are provided for fields
thety must be manually entered.</p>

<p>When the introspect button is clicked a window like the following appears.
The details depend on the record structure.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./getSubSet.gif" alt="getSubSet" /></p>
</center>

<p>This window allows the user to select an arbitrary set of fields from the
PVRecord to which the channel is attached. When the arrow for a structure
field is clicked the fields for that structure appear. A field is selected by
clicking the button next to the field name. If a structure field is selected
the entire structure is selected.</p>

<p>A request can also be specified via a text window and then clicking the
request button. The rules for specifying the request via a text string are
specified by org.epics.pvData.pvCopy See the package overview for details.</p>

<h3 id="process">process</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the process button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./process.gif" alt="process" /></p>
</center>

<p>The connect button is for connecting and disconnecting to/from a channel.
The createProcess button is for creating and destroying a channelProcess
request. The process button sends a process request to the channel access
server.</p>

<h3 id="get">get</h3>

<p>Clicking the get button of the swtshell window creates the following
window. The following shows the window after connecting to a channel and
clicking createGet.:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./get.gif" alt="get" /></p>
</center>

<p>The first row has the following widgets:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>conect</dt>
    <dd>This was described above. Note that after connecting to a channel the
      button becomes disconnect.</dd>
  <dt>createRequest</dt>
    <dd>This was described above. Note that the test window can also be
      edited.</dd>
  <dt>crateGet</dt>
    <dd>Create and destroy a channelGet request.</dd>
  <dt>get</dt>
    <dd>Issue a get request. The result is shown in the text window.</dd>
  <dt>dump</dt>
    <dd>This shows the current data values.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="put">put</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the put button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./put.gif" alt="put" /></p>
</center>

<p>Except for put the top row is just like get.</p>

<p>When the put button is clicked then what happens depends of how many
fields where selected from the PVRecord. If only a single scalar or array
field was selected, then a text entry box apppears. When a value is entered
and the return key is pressed then this value is sent via channel access.</p>

<p>If more than a single scalar or array field was selected then when put is
clicked a window appears that allows the user to provide values to each
scalar or array field of the selected fields. This window is:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./getValue.gif" alt="getValue" /></p>
</center>

<p>This display allows the user to give values to any of the scalar or array
fields.</p>

<p>If a primitive or array of primitives is selected then when edit is
clicked the following happens: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The text entry window shows the current value.</li>
  <li>After text is entered and the enter key presssed the data is put in the
    PVStructure created as a result of createRequest.</li>
</ul>

<p>When done is clicked the modified fields are sent to the channel access
server and written to the PVRecord.</p>

<h3 id="putGet">putGet</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the putGet button is pushed. It is
similar to get and put except that both a putRequest and a getRequest must be
specified.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./putGet.gif" alt="putGet" /></p>
</center>

<p>A typical use of putGet is to issue a remote procedure call. An RPC
record, by convention, has the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A top level feld named arguments.</li>
  <li>A top level field named result.</li>
  <li>Support that implements the RPC semantics.</li>
</ol>

<p>A client issues an RPC request as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Gives values to the arguments.</li>
  <li>issues a putProcessGet</li>
  <li>Gets the result values.</li>
</ol>

<p>To use the putGet swt window to issue an RPC the client connects to a RPC
record, selects process, and for the createPutRequest selects arguments from
the following window.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./RPCputRequest.gif" alt="RPCputRequest" /></p>
</center>

<p>Then result is selected from the createGetRequest window.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./RPCgetRequest.gif" alt="RPCgetRequest" /></p>
</center>

<center>
<p>The following shows an example result.</p>

<p><img src="./putGet.gif" alt="putGet" /></p>
</center>

<h3 id="channelRPC">channelRPC</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the channelRPC button is pushed. A
channelRPC returns a new PVStructure for each request. The record must
support a channelRPC request.</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./channelRPC.gif" alt="channelRPC" /></p>
</center>

<h3 id="array">array</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the array button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./array.gif" alt="array" /></p>
</center>

<p>This window has a connect/disconnect button and a createArray/destroyArray
button. It has a text entry for subField. The get button issues a array get
request. The offset and count can be specified. The result is written into
the value field of the put row. The put button issues a put array request.
The offset can be specified. The value field provides the array values. The
setLength button is used to set the length and/or capacity of the array. A
value of -1 means leave as is.</p>

<h3 id="structureA">structureArray</h3>

<p>This is used to get and modify elements of a PVStructureArray. You must
get before issuing a put. The puts will modify the data obtained via the get
and then put the data back.</p>

<p>The following window appears when the structureArray button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./structureArray.gif" alt="structureArray" /></p>
</center>

<p>This window has a connect/disconnect button and a createArray/destroyArray
button. It has a text entry for subField. The get button issues a array get
request. The offset and count can be specified. The result is written to the
consoleText window. You must issue a get before using put.</p>

<p>The put row acts on the data received from a put. You change elements by
giving a value to index and clicking putElement. A tree structured window
just like for put appears. This is changing the local data. When you click
put the data is written to the actual record. The setLength button is used to
set the length and/or capacity of the array. A value of -1 means leave as
is.</p>

<h3 id="monitor">monitor</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the monitor button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./monitor.gif" alt="monitor" /></p>
</center>

<p>The controls in the first row are similat to get and put. Note that the
queueSize can be set.</p>

<p>The other controls provide:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>serverInfo</dt>
    <dd>The status of the connection is shown </dd>
  <dt>simulateDelay</dt>
    <dd>This is for testing channel access. If a non-zero value is specified
      a delay occurs after each monitor is received.</dd>
  <dt>When start is clicked monitoring is started. It changes to a stop
  button while monitoring is active.</dt>
</dl>
<hr />

<h2 style="text-align: center" id="Local">Local JavaIOC</h2>
<hr />

<h3 id="loadDataba">loadDatabase</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the loadDatabase button is pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./loadDatabase.gif" alt="loadDatabase" /></p>
</center>

<p>This is used to load additional IOCDB definitions to a running IOC. It has
the following controls:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>find</dt>
    <dd>This brings up a file selection box that allows the selection of a
      DBD or DB file.</dd>
  <dt>show</dt>
    <dd>Lists the selected file.</dd>
  <dt>loadDB</dt>
    <dd>Adds definitions from the selected file to the JavaIOC file.
      Structure, create, and support definitions are added only if the file
      loads without error. It is an error if the definition already
    exists.</dd>
    <dd>Record instances are loaded, initialized, and started. If all of the
      new record instances are stated, then the records are added to ther
      master database. If any record fails to start, all the records are
      uinitialized and are not added to the master database.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="introspect">introspectDatabase</h3>

<p>The following window appears when the introspectDatabase button is
pushed:</p>

<center>
<p><img src="./introspectDatabase.gif" alt="introspectonsole" /></p>
</center>

<h4 id="Database">Database Definitions</h4>

<p>The top menubar allows the use to see all the structure definitions in the
master database.</p>

<h4 id="Local1">Local Record Instance</h4>

<p>The next three row allows the user to select and interact with a local
record. The select button is used to select a local record. The text window
after select shows the currently selected record and can also be used to
enter a record name. The remaining buttons apply to the selected button. They
are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>dump</dt>
    <dd>shows the contents of the record.</dd>
  <dt>showState</dt>
    <dd>shows the state of the record.</dd>
  <dt>setTrace</dt>
    <dd>Allows the user to set trace on or off.</dd>
  <dt>setEnable</dt>
    <dd>Allows the use to set the enable state on or off.</dd>
  <dt>timeProcess</dt>
    <dd>Show how many times selected record can be processed per second.</dd>
  <dt>setSupportState</dt>
    <dd>Allows the use to issue a support state method, i.e. initialize,
      start, stop, or uninitialize.</dd>
  <dt>releaseProcessor</dt>
    <dd>Allows the use to force the release of the current record processor.
      This is a dangorous operation!!</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="Show">Show Information</h4>

<p>The third row has two buttons that show information. They are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>showBadRecords</dt>
    <dd>Show all records that havesomething out of ordinary. For example
      disabled, in alarm state, active, not ready.</dd>
  <dt>showThreads</dt>
    <dd>Shows all threads created via the thread utilities in package
      org.epics.ioc.util.</dd>
