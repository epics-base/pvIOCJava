<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This package is an eclipse JUnit test for org.epics.ioc.dbAccess. It
contains The following JUnit tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XMLToDataBaseTest<br />
    Reads a set of database definition files and a set of record instance
    files. It dumps the record instances.</li>
  <li>XMLAllTypesTest<br />
    Reads a set of definitions that include all types.
  </li>
  <li>DefaultTest<br />
    Reads a set of database definition files that have defaults for all
    fields that are allowed to have defualts. Creates an instance definition
    which does not set any field values. It dumps the resultig instance.</li>
  <li>ParentTest<br />
    Reads a set of database definitions and record instances. Show the parent
    and record for specified fields.</li>
  <li>AccessTest<br />
    Tests DBAccess.</li>
  <li>ListenerTest<br />
    Tests DBListener.</li>
  <li>ReplaceTest<br />
    Test repacing the default implementation of all the field types.</li>
  <li>SubstituteTest<br />
    Tests include and macro substitution. This also is a test for pv, dbd,
    and db because XMLToDBD
    is called, which makes extensive use of dbd and pv, and
    XMLToIOCDB is called, which makes extensive use of db.
    It also provides an example of parsing database definitions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>It also has a Java class TestListener, which is used by some of the other tests
and is an example of implementing a DBListener.</p>
<p>The examples use the DBD definitions defined in javaIOC/dbd.</p>

<p>The following database definition files are available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>accessDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by AccessTest.
  </li>
  <li>aiDBD.xml
    aiRaw, aiLinear, aiLinearRecord</li>
  <li>aiLinkedDBD.xml<br />
    Definitions for an ai record that links to an aiRaw record.
  </li>
  <li>allTypesDBD.xml<br />
    A structure and recordType that has fields of every supported type.</li>
  <li>analogDBD.xml<br />
    A simple recordType definition.</li>
  <li>defaultDBD.xml<br />
    Like allTypesDBD.xml but assigns defaults to all fields that are allowed
    to have defaults.</li>
  <li>listenerDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by ListenerTest.
  </li>
  <li>parentDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by ParentTest.
  </li>
  <li>powerSupplyDBD.xml<br />
    A simple power supply for power, current, and voltage.</li>
  <li>powerSupplyLinkedDBD.xml<br />
    A simple power supply that links to other records for current and voltage.
  </li>
  <li>replaceDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by ReplaceTest.
  </li>
  <li>substituteDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by SubstituteTest.
  </li>
  <li>xmlToDataBaseDBD.xml<br />
    Include statements for the files requires by XMLToDataBaseTest.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The DB.xml files are read by the various tests.

These database files and tests are good examples of the kinds of data a
JavaIOC can hold.</p>
